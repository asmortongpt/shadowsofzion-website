## ðŸ”„ Automatic Deployments

Every time you push to GitHub:
- Cloudflare detects the change
- Builds your site
- Deploys automatically
- Takes 2-3 minutes

**No manual work needed after initial setup!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails?
- Check "Deployments" tab for error log
- Usually means missing dependency
- Message me the error

### Domain not working?
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
- Check "Custom domains" shows "Active"
- DNS was already configured earlier

### Need help?
- Cloudflare docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/
- Or just ask me!
