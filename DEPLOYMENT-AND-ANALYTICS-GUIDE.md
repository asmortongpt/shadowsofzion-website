## ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - NEEDS YOUR ACTION

### The Problem
Your website code is **updated and pushed to GitHub**, but the Cloudflare Pages deployment is **failing due to authentication**.

The live site at `https://shadowsofzion.com` still shows the old version with "Track 1, Track 2" placeholders.

### Why It's Failing
The GitHub Actions workflow needs valid Cloudflare credentials in GitHub Secrets:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` - Currently invalid/expired
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - May be incorrect

### Error Message
```
API returned: {"success":false,"errors":[{"code":10001,"message":"Unable to authenticate request"}]}
```

## ðŸ”§ HOW TO FIX (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Fastest)
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to **Pages** â†’ **shadowsofzion-website**
3. Click **"Deploy site"** or **"Retry deployment"**
4. Done! Your new version will be live in ~1 minute

### Option 2: Fix GitHub Actions (Permanent Solution)
1. Log into [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)

8. Update `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (find it in Cloudflare dashboard URL or Pages settings)
9. Push any change to trigger deployment, or click **Actions** â†’ **Re-run jobs**

### Option 3: Use Wrangler CLI (If you prefer terminal)
```bash
cd /Users/andrewmorton/Documents/GitHub/ai-band-orchestrator/shadowsofzion-website

# Get new API token from Cloudflare dashboard
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-new-token-here"

# Deploy
