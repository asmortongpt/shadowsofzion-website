## üìã HOW TO UPDATE STREAMING LINKS

When CDBaby finishes distribution (1-4 weeks), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get Your Real URLs

CDBaby will email you with links to your music on all platforms. They'll look like:
- Spotify: `https://open.spotify.com/artist/1A2B3C4D5E6F`
- Apple Music: `https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shadows-of-zion/123456789`
- Amazon: `https://music.amazon.com/artists/B08XYZABC123`

### Step 2: Update the Code

Edit these files:
1. **Homepage** (`app/page.tsx`) - around line 40-50
2. **Music Page** (`app/music/page.tsx`) - around line 20-70

Replace:
```tsx
// OLD
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/YOUR-ARTIST-ID" ...>

// NEW
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1A2B3C4D5E6F" ...>
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
git add app/page.tsx app/music/page.tsx
git commit -m "Update streaming links with real CDBaby URLs"
git push
```

Site auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes!
